# Pendu

This application allows one to play a game of "Pendu", being able to choose between three levels of difficulty.

### Installation

Download the .exe and the three .txt files.

### How to use

You can access all the information from within the application (in French). However, make sure to not modify the names of the three .txt files.

You can add more words to the files, one word by line, and following those rules to be consistent with the rules I set up:
- words between 5 to 7 letters for the Facile.txt
- words between 6 t 9 lettres for the Intermediaire.txt
- words 7 letters or more for the Difficile.txt
