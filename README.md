# Pendu

This application allows one to play a game of "Pendu", being able to choose between three levels of difficulty.

### Installation

Download the .exe and the three .txt files.

### How to use

You can access all the information from within the application (in French). However, make sure to not modify the names of the three .txt files.

You can add more words to the files, one word by line and in upper case, following those rules to be consistent with the rules I set up:
- words between 5 to 7 letters for the Facile.txt
- words between 6 to 9 letters for the Intermediaire.txt
- words 7 letters-long or more for the Difficile.txt, and it is more challenging if you choose uncommon words

If you want to add some rules, some game modes or if you want to take a look at the code, feel free to do so!

Have fun! :)
